STM32F4_RF
=================

Project based on radio communication between two adapters. 
Our focus was to check range of signal smaller than 3m, depending on different parameters.
Practical use is showed by a game(,,Radio Plane" in C#) which can be controlled by radio signal(specified in STM32F4_RF_STM_PING project compiled and downloaded on for ex. STM32F407VG).
All files are provided and STM projects use only standard CooCox library files, besides XNA environment for a game project.

Goals of this project:
* Check ranges of signals between two adapters depending on different parameters.
* Show practical usage of this kind of connection.
